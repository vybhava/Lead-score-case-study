# Lead-score-case-study
Building a logistic regression machine learning model for assigning the lead score

Problem Statement

X Education wants help in selecting the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to
convert into paying customers. The company requires to build a machine learning model, wherein a lead
score needs to be assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a
higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

Business Objective

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads
which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that
the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is
cold and will mostly not get converted
